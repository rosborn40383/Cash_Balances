This code goes through my Outlook email, grabs the most recent attachment from a certain named email. Then copies this into a dataframe and adds into the excel sheet. Main reason for writing this was to automate a tedious daily task. Limited balances is slightly different such that the data gets filtered by just the Pool column for a seperate prupose.
